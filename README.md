# AMC Activities Shortcode WordPress Plugin

[AMC Activities Shortcode](https://github.com/graybirchsolutions/amc-activities-shortcode) is a WordPress plugin to display selected trips/activities from the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) [Activities Database](https://activities.outdoors.org/) on your own website.

The AMC provides a simple API for the use of its member chapters that returns a list of upcoming activities. A user can ask for events using specific chapter, committee and/or activity codes. For example, a user might request events from the Boston Chapter + Hiking Committee or the Boston Chapter + Hiking Activities.

This plugin implements a WordPress `shortcode` that queries the API and displays the results on a page or a post as a list of upcoming events.

## Features

The plugin implements a WordPress shortcode that can be used in any page, post or section that supports shortcodes. The shortcode format is

    [amc_activities chapter=id committee=id activity=id limit=n]

The chapter ID is mandatory. All other attributes are optional, but it is recommended to use other parameters (committee, activity or limit) to restrict the list as `[amc_activities chapter=xx]` by itself will return **all** future chapter activities from the database.

The ***limit*** attribute controls how many events are displayed. The events are returned in chronological order so using limit=5 would restrict the display to the next 5 upcoming events.

Functionality to retrieve prior events is not available through the AMC's API and cannot be added through this plugin.

Additional documentation - including a list of valid codes - can be found on our Wiki page at https://github.com/graybirchsolutions/amc-activities-shortcode/wiki
